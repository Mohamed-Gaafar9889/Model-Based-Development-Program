1. Designing the Temperature Control System in Simulink:

For the first step of the project, I created a Simulink model to represent the temperature control system. Utilizing Simulink's versatile block library, I assembled the necessary components to simulate the system dynamics based on the provided mathematical equation. This included integrators, gains, and feedback loops to accurately model the behavior of the temperature control system.

2. Defining Constants and Inputs:

In the second step, I defined the constants and inputs required for the simulation. After careful consideration, I chose suitable values for the time constant (\( \tau \)) and ultimate gain (\( K_u \)) based on the system's characteristics and performance requirements. Additionally, I created a step input signal, such as a step function, to represent the desired setpoint temperature (\( T_{\text{setpoint}} \)).


With the Simulink model configured and inputs defined, I proceeded to simulate the temperature control system. Executing the simulation allowed me to observe the system's response to changes in the setpoint temperature. I analyzed various aspects of the system's behavior, including transient response, steady-state accuracy, and any oscillations or overshoot present in the response.

4. Parameter Tuning:

In the final step, I focused on parameter tuning to optimize the control parameters for desired performance. By experimenting with different values of \( \tau \) and \( K_u \), I iteratively adjusted the parameters and reran the simulation to observe their effects on the system's response. This iterative process enabled me to fine-tune the parameters to achieve the desired transient response, steady-state accuracy, and stability of the temperature control system.

Finally according to results I foiund that systm gain affect the response strongly as the higher it is , the faster the response. On the other hand tau affects the response either. The lower the tau the faster the response.
